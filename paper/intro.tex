\section{Introduction [Robbie, Wayne, Oscar]}
\begin{itemize}
  \item General scientific background What are wavefront codes? Why
    are they important? Who uses them?
  \item Case study: Minisweep. Real application. Subroutine of
    Denovo. Why is Denovo important to ORNL? What is it used for?
  \item what are the other similar codes ? KRIPTI that follows
    wavefront patterns
\end{itemize}

Contribution List
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Parallel algorithm framework (novel extensions) [Tied closely
    with section 3/research contribution]
  \item Case Study - Minisweep
  \item Scientific Contribution - Real App (Denovo) which helps model
    what happens inside of a nuclear reactor. The more runs we can do
    with different parameters, the more information scientists will
    have about the reactor they are modeling.
\end{enumerate}
